### Problem: Rickshaw Fare

In the streets of Old Dhaka, Ayman runs a rickshaw fare counter. Every time a passenger rides a rickshaw, Ayman notes down the fare. At the end of a day, he wants to calculate how much he earned from all rides.

Can you help Ayman sum up the total fare for a day?

#### Input
The input has two lines:

- The first line contains an integer `N` — the number of rickshaw rides in a day
- The second line has `N` space-separated integers — the fare for each ride in Bangladeshi Taka.

#### Constraints
- `1 ≤ N ≤ 100`
- `0 ≤ fare ≤ 1000`

#### Output
For each day, print a single line:
`Total Fare: X`

Where `X` is the sum of all the fares on a day.

#### Sample Input

3
20 30 50


#### Sample Output

Total Fare: 100
