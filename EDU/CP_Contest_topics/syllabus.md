# ⚔️ 5-Day Dynamic Programming Bootcamp

**Goal:** Learn & implement all **core DP patterns** needed to crush 1400–1600 rated problems.  
**Total Time:** ~2–3 hrs/day  
**Focus:** Understanding patterns + solving real problems.

---

## 📅 **Day 1 – Intro to DP + Fibonacci + Min Cost**

### 🧠 Concepts:
- What is DP? (Memoization vs Tabulation)
- Recurrence relations
- State transitions
- Base cases

### ✅ Practice:
1. [Fibonacci (top-down & bottom-up)](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/365/A)
2. [Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)
3. [Min Cost Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/)

---

## 📅 **Day 2 – 0/1 Knapsack + Subset Sum**

### 🧠 Concepts:
- 2D DP: `dp[i][w]` = best value using first `i` items with weight `w`
- Space optimization (2 rows / 1D)
- Subset sum logic

### ✅ Practice:
1. [Subset Sum](https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp/tasks/dp_d)
2. [Knapsack 1](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/0)
3. [Classic 0/1 Knapsack](https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp/tasks/dp_b)

---

## 📅 **Day 3 – Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**

### 🧠 Concepts:
- 1D DP: `dp[i] = max(dp[j] + 1)` if `a[i] > a[j]`
- Binary Search LIS (optional for 1700+ later)

### ✅ Practice:
1. [LIS – Basic](https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp/tasks/dp_l)
2. [CSES - LIS](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1145/)
3. [Longest Bitonic Subsequence](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-bitonic-subsequence/)

---

## 📅 **Day 4 – Classic Patterns: Coin Change, Palindrome DP**

### 🧠 Concepts:
- Coin change: count vs min coins
- Palindromic substrings
- State design: `dp[i]` meaning, overlapping subproblems

### ✅ Practice:
1. [Coin Change 1 (Ways)](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-ii/)
2. [Coin Change 2 (Fewest Coins)](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)
3. [Palindrome Partitioning](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning/)

---

## 📅 **Day 5 – Contest Simulation + Upsolve**

### ⚔️ Virtual DP-Only Contest:
- [CF 580C – Kefa and Park](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/580/C)
- [CF 474D – Flowers](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/474/D)
- [CF 467C – George and Job](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/467/C)
- [CF 545C – Woodcutters](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/545/C)

### 🔄 Post-Contest:
- Add an extra day for `digit dp` or `prefix dp` if needed
